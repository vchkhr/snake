# Snake
Snake C++ and OpenGL Game

## Skills
C++, OpenGL, freeglut

## Abstract
The object of research is the complete cycle of software development - the computer game "Snake".\
The purpose of the course work is to systematize and generalize knowledge of C ++, obtained during the courses "Fundamentals of Programming", "Fundamentals of Programming (Part 2)", "Fundamentals of Software Systems Architecture" and "Fundamentals of Algorithm Theory" and familiarization with OpenGL technology.\
Based on the capabilities of the OpenGL graphics library and its extension, Freeglut was developed and debugged in C++ in Visual Studio 2017, which allows you to try the game "Snake" on your computer or laptop. Based on the capabilities of OpenGL, a user interface and game mechanics have been created. Object-oriented programming capabilities are used, the application consists of several modules.\
As a result of the course work, the computer game "Snake" was created in the
C++ programming language in 3D style.\
Developed software can be used for entertainment purposes as a computer game.
To further develop the game, you can add new objects and structures, textures and new game modes.\
